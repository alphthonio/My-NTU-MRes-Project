# My-NTU-MRes-Project
The research studied the adsorption of drug molecules in functionalised UiO-66 type MOFs and analysed the plausible adsorption mechanisms that optimized adsorption and the dependence of adsorption performance on the location and orientation of the amino functional groups in the Metal Organic Frameworks.
